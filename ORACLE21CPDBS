1.	Introduction 
The aim of the task was focusing on how to work with Oracle 21c Multitenant 
Architecture, particularly the creation, management, and deletion of Pluggable Databases (PDBs) within a Container Database (CDB). 
The main objectives were: 
•	To understand and apply commands such as CREATE, ALTER and DROP 
PLUGGABLE DATABASE. 
•	To create a new pluggable database for classwork. 
•	To create and delete another pluggable database for practice. 
•	To verify the operations using Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM). 
2.	Environment Setup 
• 	Operating System: Windows 11 Pro • 	Oracle Version: Oracle Database 21c • 	Tools Used: 
o 	SQL*Plus o 	SQL Developer o 	Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) 
NOTE: Before starting, the Oracle listener and database services were verified to be running using: services.msc 
3.	Task 1 – Creating the First Pluggable Database 
Objective: 
Create a new PDB for classwork named pdb_NIYIBIZI28248 and assign an admin user. 
SQL Script: 
CONNECT sys/your_password AS SYSDBA; 
 
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_NIYIBIZI28248 
  ADMIN USER Niyibizi _plsqlauca_28248 IDENTIFIED BY oracle123   ROLES = (DBA) 
  CREATE_FILE_DEST = 'C:\ORACLE21C\ORADATA\ORCL\PDB_Niyibizi28248'; 
 
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_Niyibizi28248 OPEN READ WRITE; 
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_28248 SAVE STATE; SHOW PDBS; 
Explanation: 
•	CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE – creates a new PDB within the container. 
•	ADMIN USER – defines the administrator for this PDB. 
•	CREATE_FILE_DEST – specifies where Oracle will store the new database files. 
•	ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ... OPEN READ WRITE – opens the PDB for use. 
•	SAVE STATE – ensures it reopens automatically on database restart. 
Result: 
The PDB was created successfully and appeared under SHOW PDBS as READ WRITE.

4.	Task 2 – Creating and Deleting a Second PDB 
Objective: 
Create another pluggable database named NI_to_delete_pdb_28248 and then delete it to demonstrate full database lifecycle management. 
SQL Script (Creation): 
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE Ni_to_delete_pdb_28248 
  ADMIN USER Niyibizi_plsqlauca_2828248 IDENTIFIED BY . 
  ROLES = (DBA) 
  CREATE_FILE_DEST = 'C:\ORACLE21C\ORADATA\ORCL\Ni_TO_DELETE_PDB_28248'; Open and Verify: 
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE NI_to_delete_pdb_28248 OPEN READ WRITE; SHOW PDBS;

SQL Script (Deletion): 
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE NI_to_delete_pdb_28248 CLOSE IMMEDIATE; 
DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE NI_to_delete_pdb_28248 INCLUDING DATAFILES; SHOW PDBS; 
Explanation: 
•	The PDB must be closed before deletion. 
•	INCLUDING DATAFILES ensures that all associated files are removed from disk. 
•	SHOW PDBS confirms removal from the container database. 
Output after executing DROP command showing the PDB is no longer listed

5.	Task 3 – Managing PDBs via Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) 
Objective: 
Verify the existence and status of PDBs using the graphical interface of Oracle Enterprise Manager. 
Procedure: 
1.	Accessed OEM at: 
2.	https://localhost:5500/em 
3.	Logged in using the SYS user in Container Database (CDB) mode. 
4.	Navigated to: 
Container Database → Pluggable Databases 
➢ Verified: pdb_ Niyibizi28248 appears as OPEN (READ WRITE). 
o	NI_to_delete_pdb_28248 no longer exists after deletion. 
o	OEM interface showing the active PDBs list.
